# Daily vulnerability remediation — activation v2

## Current scope (2026-10-18; supersedes the historical contract below)

- Owner: A · Partager la maintenance; Tous les dépôts prêts;
  Fix + revue autonome; Dans gh. No activation or main mutation.
- Spec digest: 624146043693f553cd50cd4c6f3f618242f1066866511eba09f76009dcc58593;
  two supplied final-spec GO-CODE reviews. Final code review remains open.
- Rebase: origin/main 7ebbcf266e1988c18624d0158936949a214f9fd8, including #348.
  Only BRANCH.md conflicted; both histories retained.
- Actual implementation paths: packages/h2a/src/vuln-fix/controller.mjs,
  state.mjs, verify.mjs, scan.mjs; test/vuln-fix-merge.test.js (new),
  test/vuln-fix-controller.test.js; contract and operator reference.
- No runtime/pin/lock/workflow/Track changes. Other-repository lots are
  inventoried only. Source/build/runtime state remains isolated from the host.

## Activation lots

- [x] L0 documentary inventory and execution sheets; G0 remains partial for
  unresolved external interfaces/placement, not declared globally green.
- [x] L5 independent exact-SHA gate, durable intent/result and reconciliation
  before scan/daily claims, no inference/accounting repetition.
- [x] L5 temporary-remote positive merge, checks/age restart, lost ack,
  concurrency, changed head/base and fail-closed evidence/permission guards.
- [x] L6 independent scan/fix-blocked reporting and explicit admissions stop.
- [ ] L1 published import API; L2 qualified identity/Muse/permissions pool;
  L3 shared authority/confinement; L3-R renewal/delivery/next consumption.
- [ ] L4 OQ1 placement derivation and production adapters/scheduler; L5 live
  integration/new owned-candidate creation; L6 repository/live qualification.
- [ ] L7 five-provider live usages/scenarios/author rotation (not first activation).
- [ ] G3/G5: real chain proof, exact-final-SHA code reviews, conductor full CI.
- [ ] G4/G6 activation/production acceptance: conductor/operator after release.

## Evidence

- L5 initial RED: 0/4 pass; GREEN: 4/4. Further regression RED: 5/8 pass;
  GREEN: 8/8. Observation/permission RED: 46/50 pass; GREEN: 50/50.
- L6 controller RED: 15/17 pass; GREEN: 17/17.
- Targeted repository 11/11, scan 9/9, CLI 4/4, redaction 10/10.
  All skip/cancel/TODO counts zero. Exact commands/output excerpts are in
  docs/specs/SPEC_EVOL_DAILY_VULN_FIX.md. No full local suite.
- Review selection-failed: no installed h2a access, exact author model/effort
  unavailable. No dispatched leg or consensus invented. G5 remains open.
- Pending delivery: own-branch lease push, final-SHA CI results in owner report.

# Historical #371 implementation record

## Objective
- [ ] Ship daily vulnerability detection/remediation through local seats, command, skill and timer.

## Scope / Guardrails
- [x] Owner directive 2026-10-17 selects local daily systemd, local seats, manual merge; no VA questions.
- [x] No live host/state, installed h2a, main mutation, attribution, Python or full local suite.
- [x] Tests use temporary state and targeted files only; no silent skips.

## Branch Scope Boundaries
- [x] **Allowed Paths (implementation scope)**
  - [x] `packages/h2a/src/vuln-fix/**`
  - [x] `packages/h2a/src/bin.ts`
  - [x] `packages/h2a/src/cli.ts`
  - [x] `packages/h2a/src/cli-contract.ts`
  - [x] `packages/h2a/src/cli-command-map.ts`

  - [x] `.github/**`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.track/**`; owner host/state, installed dist and main.
- [x] **Conditional Paths**
  - [x] Systemd units rendered only to an explicitly selected directory; operator activates outside confinement.

## Plan / TODO
- [x] **Lot 1 — Detection**
  - [x] Discover lock domains; npm HIGH/CRITICAL, hydrated OSV, custom source interface.
  - [x] Prove incomplete scans cannot become clean and private packages stay local.

- [x] **Lot 2 — Controller**
  - [x] Durable claims, round robin, isolated worktrees, pinned verification and draft PRs.
  - [x] Lock-only, no majors, two independent complementary reviews before ready.
  - [x] Fake-runner coverage for restart, concurrent lock, dry run and failure gates.

- [x] **Lot 3 — Operator surface**
  - [x] Local runner adapter, command, skill, inventory configuration, timer rendering.
  - [x] Stable report, summary and explicit activation/coverage limits.

- [ ] **Lot 4 — Delivery**
  - [x] Reconcile two independent design reviews and record actual consensus availability.
  - [ ] Targeted verification, push, English PR, each CI result and French report.

Harness consensus review is selection-failed: the required installed h2a/mesh
access is forbidden by the owner's confinement. No peer consensus claimed.

# Inherited context from origin/main

# Claude seat on the common seat model (realign 2026-10-13, r8)

Branch: `feat/claude-seat-h2a-lots` (worktree `claude-seat-lots`).
Scope: Claude subscription seat for llm-mesh, realigned on the model every
other seat follows (owner decision 2026-10-13, DEC-118): same facade
enrollment shape, mesh-side storage/refresh, gateway registry wiring, same
test families — nothing Claude-specific.

State: **enrolled seats route through the mesh; serving needs the official
`claude` CLI on `PATH`**. The gateway always composes mesh
`ClaudeCodeRuntimeClient` on the h2a runner into the provider registry via
`AnthropicAdapter`, with no per-seat configuration. The runner resolves
`claude` from `PATH` per attempt (generic spawn safety only: no version
pin, no digest, no attestation). A seat with no enrolled account (or no
`claude` on `PATH`) never serves a route — fail-closed per attempt, like
every other seat. The pre-acquire seam halt is gone — account locking
lives in the mesh directory like every other seat.

Removed without replacement (no other seat carries them): egress/netns
guard (`egressNetnsReader`, `H2A_CLAUDE_EGRESS_ENFORCED`, `/proc` netns
checks), org-proof handoff, managed-config + registry/MDM guards, h2a-side
account lease lock, seam-gate attempt binding, seat-qualification env
configuration (`H2A_CLAUDE_BINARY_PATH` / `H2A_CLAUDE_BINARY_DIGEST`),
version pin + digest/attestation machinery.

Kept: facade enrollment (OAuth default + `--from cli` official store +
`--from token` secret-manager pipe, DEC-119), mesh keyring
storage/refresh, transport-specific hygiene of the CLI seat
(identity-proven sweep, sandbox transport, cleanup blocking the result,
root-level static error boundary (inherited by every subcommand —
commander never prints its own text: `outputError` is a no-op,
`exitOverride` writes a static message chosen ONLY from `err.code`
(unknown option, unknown command, too many arguments, missing argument,
option argument missing, required option not specified, conflicting option,
invalid argument, fallback); no declared name kept, no counts, no suggestion;
multi-line values ending a line with `'` or `.`, unknown commands with
newline, `remove` with a dotted first line all static; proven by a 34-form
property canary with exact static-shape asserts for every form),
masked TTY input / piped-token boundary (never
argv, never logged). The startup sweep runs at every gateway
composition even with no Claude account enrolled.

Import note (differs from muse by mesh limitation 0.25.0): `--from cli`
is a point-in-time COPY — the mesh never writes the official store file,
but its copy refreshes independently, so re-run `--from cli` when the
grant rotates. Linux store file only; macOS keychain unverified.

Follow-ups (not built here, other seats unchanged): `--from cli` on
codex/cloud-code/mistral-vibe, `--from token` on
codex/cloud-code/mistral-vibe/muse, a mesh-side Claude store leg
(CLI sole writer, mesh re-reads at refresh), the shared GitHub-secret +
cron refresh/re-enroll circuit (exists for NO seat today).

Validation: `tsc -b` clean; seat suites green
(`claude-code-cli-*`, `claude-seat-input`, `llm-mesh-accounts`,
`gateway-host/claude-code-seat-wiring`, `gateway-host/host`,
`runtime-llm-mesh-account`); `gh pr checks 327 -R rhanka/h2a` green.
Reports under `.h2a/` stay untracked; the r8 report lives in
`.h2a/build/claude_seat_r8_report.md` (untracked) and the seat-model
inventory in `.h2a/build/seat_model_inventory.md` (untracked).

# Inherited context from updated origin/main

# Focus decision dossier kit
# L2-s — PR 348 Tour 3

Owner scope: rev348-r2.md, root corrections with targeted red/green evidence,
rebase onto origin/main, own-branch push with lease, per-job CI and Tour 3 report.
No main, Track, scanner, allowlist, real native host or installed h2a access.

- Native interactive/headless IPC preserves non-seat authentication. Seat
  launches consume the materializer environment; sanitization searches values
  only for explicitly supplied secrets.
- Serialized-only renewable fixtures delegate canonical references under
  trusted custody and exclusive family tickets. Native access references and
  canonical material reach the synthetic file/keyring payloads distinctly.
- Native Vibe TOML editor update/removal regression; 16 serialized matrix cells
  with disposal, capture and persisted clearance; strict lifecycle validation.
- Public fixture/codec/materialization exports have a runtime red/green test.
- Finding 3: real L1 PR 681@7293130ee3f6 discovered and pinned. All five
  CLI cli/token sources route to its consumer parser/importSeatBundle API,
  never to renewable product imports. Private profile and bounded stdin only.
  Ten imports/reload/expiry/401/explicit-refresh tested against pinned L1
  sources with zero provider calls. Publication remains an external gate;
  older installed APIs refuse before input. Details: docs/cli-seat-l2s.md.
- Sources/declarations and native op compiled only into disposable proof dirs.
  No full local suite. No peer consensus: installed/native dispatch forbidden.

# Earlier branch records

# Focus publication — owner decision 2026-10-17

Branch: feat/focus-publish. Implement the accepted release-wave decision:
focus 0.5.0 is independent of the h2a 0.98.7 train. RC suffix follows the
h2a tag; all five verified tarballs and versions enter the same-tree proof.
Backfills must refuse an older four-package prepare helper before publication.
Scope: release/rehearsal workflows, release/candidate/rehearsal helpers and
qualified execution snapshot, named release tests, release documentation.
No tag, npm publication, installed h2a, owner state, Track writes or full
local suite. Tests use disposable HOME/XDG/TMP directories.

- [x] Red regression evidence: 48/61 then 25/32; no skips.
- [x] Initial six targeted Node test files: 93/93, zero skips; actual focus tarball
  dry-run without node_modules exit 0. Packed schema/validator and registry
  digests checked; logs: /home/antoinefa/.cache/focuspub-{red,contract-red,green,rehearsal}.log.
- [x] Legacy-preparation regression: 12/14 red before the focus-version
  handoff guard, then six files 95/95 green with zero skips; same-tree focus
  preparation is required for RC and stable.
Publication: conventional commits, own-branch push and English PR; per-job
CI outcomes are maintained in the owner-requested focuspub-report.md.

Harness consensus review is selection-failed: the required installed h2a/mesh
access is forbidden by the owner's confinement. No peer consensus claimed.

# Inherited context from origin/main
# L2-s — PR 348 Tour 2

Owner scope: rebase onto origin/main, address every finding in rev348.md with
red/green targeted tests, push this branch with lease, append Tour 2 and every
CI job to the requested report. No main/Track/guard/allowlist edits.

Allowed correction scope: cli-seat-{codecs,fixtures,materialization}.ts and
their named tests, cli-seat-direct-matrix.test.js; native-host.ts,
llm-mesh-accounts.ts and its temporary-directory tests, index.ts aliases,
cli-seat-runtime-wiring.test.ts, this record and docs/cli-seat-l2s.md.

- Explicit channel authority, unavailable refusal, strict pinned envelope.
- Native credential/MCP paths, private XDG/no-follow files, injected agy keyring.
- Closed MCP environment, separate profile, three sanitized native captures.
- Real materializer matrix, independent diagonal actors, lab billing admission.
- Exclusive family journal, unique stream ids, exact persisted handoff.
- Scenario/codec tool gate, adversarial canaries, precedence/base64/401 guards.
- Targeted baseline controls retain 71/80 red regressions, 13/13 wiring red,
  20/20 diagonal failures and a cross-process admission failure; final tests/typechecks are in the owner report.
- Finding 3 remains partially blocked by the published L1 facade: no generic
  five-provider cli/token import with external refresh policy. Preserve its
  refusal, do not fabricate an API or duplicate the store. Explicit owner,
  scope and acceptance are in docs/cli-seat-l2s.md. No mergeability claim.
- Confinement forbids installed/native h2a review dispatch; no new consensus.
  All test children are synchronous/owned, HOME/XDG are disposable; no full
  local suite, provider state, Python or real credentials.

# L2-s — PR 348 CI repair

- Owner scope: rebase `feat/cli-seat-l2s` onto `origin/main`, repair the three
  failed CI jobs without weakening tests, push with lease, and append `CI` to
  the owner's `l2s-report.md`. No main or Track writes.
- Rebased onto `3113014fe`; all three original jobs fail the same gateway
  eradication ratchet on three provider references introduced by L2-s.
- Minimal repair scope: fixture provenance comments, live-stub receipt
  diagnostics, its targeted regression in `cli-seat-direct-matrix.test.js`,
  and `docs/cli-seat-l2s.md`. Keep the scanner and allowlist unchanged.
- Named tests only, temporary HOME/XDG/TMP roots, no installed h2a/native host,
  provider credentials, Python, foreign process access or full local suite.
- Native h2a/mesh review dispatch remains forbidden by the owner's confinement;
  no external consensus is claimed.
- Evidence: `node --test packages/h2a/test/gateway-eradication.test.js`:
  3/4 before, 4/4 after. The final direct-matrix regression against the old
  stub fails 103/104 on Node 22 and 24, then passes 104/104 after repair.
  Six named `cli-seat-*.test.ts` files pass 76/76 on both Node versions.
  No skips; scanner/allowlist unchanged. Detailed commands, logs and per-job
  CI results are retained in the owner's report.
- L1 update: npm 0.26.1 now exports the bundle via its public node entry.
  Five-CLI seat import and external refresh-policy APIs remain absent from
  the inspected facade contract; exact handoff: `docs/cli-seat-l2s.md`.

# Inherited workspace scope guard record from origin/main

# Workspace scope guard

- [ ] Objective: default portable Focus design-system dossiers with mobile ecosystem canvases.
- [ ] Scope: h2a Focus CLI, isolated Svelte consumer, reusable catalog, template, skill and targeted tests.
- [x] Guardrails: owner confinement; no installed h2a, host state, Python, full local suite or main writes.
- [x] Allowed: packages/h2a/focus-kit/**, src/focus-build.ts, bin.ts, CLI help, package metadata;
      packages/track/skills/present-decision/**; named tests; build script, CI and documentation.
- [x] Forbidden: reference kit writes, other runtime behavior and long-term DS renderer ownership.
- [x] Design: use h2a focus build, a native Focus extension, and bundle @sentropic/focus/validate unchanged.
- [x] Lot 1: closed document template, ecosystem catalog, validator/build command; focus-build.test.js.
- [x] Lot 2: DS Svelte renderer, light/dark, cards, pinch zoom, portable artifact; browser fixture.
- [x] Lot 3: default skill, exact command, documentation, targeted skill and schema tests.
- [ ] Lot 4: package verification, push own branch, English PR, per-job CI report.
- [x] Feedback: harness review selection-failed; installed h2a/mesh access forbidden by owner.
- [x] Feedback: no Track writes through installed tools; no consensus or review identity claimed.
- [x] Feedback: generated renderer and lockfile exceed suggested commit size; bounded to requested consumer.
- [x] Tour 2 scope: optional plain-JSON diagram-core SemanticDocument on Focus DiagramNode;
      canonical schema/validator/readability, catalog, interim xyflow consumer and targeted regressions.
- [x] Design contract: generic@1, semantic records only; no Focus scene model, view, geometry or layout hint.
- [x] Layout L-R1..L-R11 remains DS-owned; interim placement exists only inside the xyflow adapter.
- [x] Rebase origin/main: already up to date at the start of Tour 2.
- [x] Final rebase includes #364; only BRANCH.md conflicted; Focus scope retained.
- [x] Direct delivery dependencies: regenerate Focus registry digests and Track focus-vendor
      after changing canonical schema/validation. Red vendor drift and packed digest proofs recorded.
- [x] Last round #368: close nested semantic records; regenerate authoritative Mermaid fallback;
      budget displayed scene labels once while retaining opaque-code checks.
- [x] Last round #368: reuse canonical question/option grouping and recommendation naming;
      resolve local selections across linked sets; browser coverage at 320px and 390px.
- [x] Regression proofs: all five reviewer findings reproduced red, then CLI/browser 32/32 green;
      readability 69/69 green; isolated temporary state and no skipped tests.

## Objective
- [x] Enforce workspace ownership in shipped development hooks.

## Scope / Guardrails
- [x] Own worktree only; no live h2a state, installed binary or full local suite.
- [x] No version bump, attribution or main mutation.

## Branch Scope Boundaries
- [x] Allowed: packages/h2a/hooks/**, targeted scope tests, hosts/plugin.ts,
  hosts/vibe-equipment.ts, hosts/vibe-discovery.ts, hosts/native-convergence.ts,
  hosts/native-files.ts, hosts/native-toml.ts, hosts/native-inspection.ts, cli.ts, plugin manifests,
  test/native-host-convergence.test.js, test/native-host-review-regressions.test.js,
  test/host-plugin.test.js, test/native-host-shared-skills.test.js,
  docs/workspace-scope-guard.md, docs/specs/SPEC_EVOL_WORKSPACE_SCOPE_GUARD.md,
  docs/reviews/workspace-scope-guard/**, BRANCH.md.
- [x] Direct CI blocker: scripts/test-inventory.json (host-plugin normative title).
- [x] Forbidden: live host state, unrelated sources, dependency/version changes.

## Lot 1
- [x] Classifier, signed grants, typed audit and owner command.
- [x] Red/green: workspace-scope-guard.test.js.

## Lot 2
- [x] Host plumbing and targeted workspace-scope-hosts.test.js.

## Lot 3
- [x] Documentation, review outcome, push, PR and individual CI reporting.

## Feedback Loop
- [x] Independent security/coverage design reviews: pin launch identity, inspect
  remote destinations and committed bumps, preserve private packages.
- [x] h2a consensus unavailable: no h2a MCP in confinement; do not reach live host.

- [x] Preserve read-only npm version and private package versioning; published siblings still require release authority.
- [x] Restrict helper execution and manual session initialization while preserving source inspection.

## Tour 2 — Independent review #364
- [x] R1: agy native payloads and SessionStart/PreToolUse; Muse project hooks verified against the public Meta CLI; six-host enforcement/grant/version matrix.
- [x] R2: scoped shell cwd/environment, executable heredocs/substitutions, git/gh options, package script aliases.
- [x] R3: shell redirections before every executable/builtin; runtime/helper protection; static Codex envelopes and dynamic refusal.
- [x] R4: root-relative manifests, pinned session baseline, path commits, matching refspecs, MultiEdit and separate foreign/release grants.
- [x] R5: startup-pinned plugin key, normalized grant options/repositories, Vibe native-session journal and refreshed explicit trust.
- [x] R6: quoted prose, own --all, native test runner flags, current PR resolution, branch reads, literal patch envelopes.
- [x] R7: exact repo/action/ref/session in both refusal channels.
- [ ] Fresh author-complementary h2a consensus: unavailable in confinement (no h2a MCP; no real-state access authorized).

## Tour 3 — Independent review rev364-r2.md
- [x] R1: agy global-hook cwd, native workspacePaths SessionStart binding, JSON startup output, multi-session --write installation; explicit Muse project installation only.
- [x] R2: fail-closed shell grammar/state, wrappers, balanced cwd stacks, HOME/OLDPWD/directory stack, continuations, stdin/runtime paths and independent Git directory selectors.
- [x] R3: protect hook configuration, installer metadata, helper code and journals; destination options, destructive Git commands and indirect/reflective JS capability access.
- [x] R4: inspect index independently of commit operands, enumerate pushed refs, match full patch paths and honor native line ranges.
- [x] R5: lex JS strings/comments separately and decode literals before shell classification; preserve legitimate commit messages.
- [x] CI blocker: normative inventory follows the existing agy/Muse installation test, without removing its execution requirement.
- [ ] Fresh h2a consensus remains unavailable; no independent verdict claimed for the new diff.

## Tour 4 — Fail closed on uncertainty (conductor decision)
- [x] Remove heredoc preprocessing and executable substitution/shell-script interpretation; refuse opaque protected intent with a typed request for the plain explicit form or owner grant.
- [x] Check dynamic sensitive argv before action selection; cover runtime stdin/eval, independent Git directories, symlinks, file destination options and Git mutation forms from rev364-r3.md.
- [x] Preserve explicit own copy/move/mkdir operations, conditional own cwd alternatives, plain protected actions and valid JavaScript escapes; reject duplicate command members using the shared lexer.
- [x] Compare complete proposed/base manifests, preserve baseline publication across private toggles, and inspect the union of explicit pushed refs and tags; bind sessions before recording baselines.
- [x] Targeted regression proof: 76 T4 tests on original HEAD (7 pass, 69 fail, 0 skipped), then 76 pass, 0 fail, 0 skipped after correction.
- [x] Centralize symlink uncertainty before canonicalization, including env/npm selectors and dangling effective copy destinations: three additional red/green regressions.
- [ ] Full native sessions, remote mutations and independent h2a consensus remain outside confinement qualification; full repository suite is reserved for the conductor.

# L2-s — PR 348 Dernier tour

- Owner scope: rev348-r3.md, minimal correction, rebase onto origin/main,
  own-branch lease push and per-job CI in the owner report.
- Rebased onto df5652b18; only BRANCH.md conflicted. Both branch records
  were retained, including the complete workspace scope guard record.
- The sole finding is still externally blocked: Sentropic PR 681 is OPEN;
  registry latest is llm-mesh 0.26.1 / cluster-mesh 0.18.0. An isolated
  install of those published packages fails all three API availability
  assertions (3 failed, 0 skipped). No green-after or closure is claimed.
- Keep the fail-closed import guard and dependency lock unchanged. Do not
  merge with this reserve. L1 must publish its import API, then h2a can pin
  compatible published versions and qualify all ten cli/token imports.
- Targeted post-rebase enrollment/dispatch/regression suites: 6 files,
  118 passed, 0 skipped. Full local suite and native/installed h2a forbidden.
## Feedback Loop
- [x] Design reviews: scanner/identity safety and controller correctness; findings integrated into design.
- [x] No installed h2a MCP available in confinement; no h2a seat consensus claimed.
- [x] BR01-EX1: no Makefile in repo; selective direct git commits.
- [x] BR01-EX2: cohesive controller lots may exceed 150 lines; minimal paths, no unrelated changes.
