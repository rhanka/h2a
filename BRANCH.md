# Focus publication — owner decision 2026-10-17

Branch: feat/focus-publish. Implement the accepted release-wave decision:
focus 0.5.0 is independent of the h2a 0.98.7 train. RC suffix follows the
h2a tag; all five verified tarballs and versions enter the same-tree proof.
Backfills must refuse an older four-package prepare helper before publication.
Scope: release/rehearsal workflows, release/candidate/rehearsal helpers and
qualified execution snapshot, named release tests, release documentation.
No tag, npm publication, installed h2a, owner state, Track writes or full
local suite. Tests use disposable HOME/XDG/TMP directories.

- [x] Red regression evidence: 48/61 then 25/32; no skips.
- [x] Initial six targeted Node test files: 93/93, zero skips; actual focus tarball
  dry-run without node_modules exit 0. Packed schema/validator and registry
  digests checked; logs: /home/antoinefa/.cache/focuspub-{red,contract-red,green,rehearsal}.log.
- [x] Legacy-preparation regression: 12/14 red before the focus-version
  handoff guard, then six files 95/95 green with zero skips; same-tree focus
  preparation is required for RC and stable.
Publication: conventional commits, own-branch push and English PR; per-job
CI outcomes are maintained in the owner-requested focuspub-report.md.

Harness consensus review is selection-failed: the required installed h2a/mesh
access is forbidden by the owner's confinement. No peer consensus claimed.

# Inherited context from origin/main

# Claude seat on the common seat model (realign 2026-10-13, r8)

Branch: `feat/claude-seat-h2a-lots` (worktree `claude-seat-lots`).
Scope: Claude subscription seat for llm-mesh, realigned on the model every
other seat follows (owner decision 2026-10-13, DEC-118): same facade
enrollment shape, mesh-side storage/refresh, gateway registry wiring, same
test families — nothing Claude-specific.

State: **enrolled seats route through the mesh; serving needs the official
`claude` CLI on `PATH`**. The gateway always composes mesh
`ClaudeCodeRuntimeClient` on the h2a runner into the provider registry via
`AnthropicAdapter`, with no per-seat configuration. The runner resolves
`claude` from `PATH` per attempt (generic spawn safety only: no version
pin, no digest, no attestation). A seat with no enrolled account (or no
`claude` on `PATH`) never serves a route — fail-closed per attempt, like
every other seat. The pre-acquire seam halt is gone — account locking
lives in the mesh directory like every other seat.

Removed without replacement (no other seat carries them): egress/netns
guard (`egressNetnsReader`, `H2A_CLAUDE_EGRESS_ENFORCED`, `/proc` netns
checks), org-proof handoff, managed-config + registry/MDM guards, h2a-side
account lease lock, seam-gate attempt binding, seat-qualification env
configuration (`H2A_CLAUDE_BINARY_PATH` / `H2A_CLAUDE_BINARY_DIGEST`),
version pin + digest/attestation machinery.

Kept: facade enrollment (OAuth default + `--from cli` official store +
`--from token` secret-manager pipe, DEC-119), mesh keyring
storage/refresh, transport-specific hygiene of the CLI seat
(identity-proven sweep, sandbox transport, cleanup blocking the result,
root-level static error boundary (inherited by every subcommand —
commander never prints its own text: `outputError` is a no-op,
`exitOverride` writes a static message chosen ONLY from `err.code`
(unknown option, unknown command, too many arguments, missing argument,
option argument missing, required option not specified, conflicting option,
invalid argument, fallback); no declared name kept, no counts, no suggestion;
multi-line values ending a line with `'` or `.`, unknown commands with
newline, `remove` with a dotted first line all static; proven by a 34-form
property canary with exact static-shape asserts for every form),
masked TTY input / piped-token boundary (never
argv, never logged). The startup sweep runs at every gateway
composition even with no Claude account enrolled.

Import note (differs from muse by mesh limitation 0.25.0): `--from cli`
is a point-in-time COPY — the mesh never writes the official store file,
but its copy refreshes independently, so re-run `--from cli` when the
grant rotates. Linux store file only; macOS keychain unverified.

Follow-ups (not built here, other seats unchanged): `--from cli` on
codex/cloud-code/mistral-vibe, `--from token` on
codex/cloud-code/mistral-vibe/muse, a mesh-side Claude store leg
(CLI sole writer, mesh re-reads at refresh), the shared GitHub-secret +
cron refresh/re-enroll circuit (exists for NO seat today).

Validation: `tsc -b` clean; seat suites green
(`claude-code-cli-*`, `claude-seat-input`, `llm-mesh-accounts`,
`gateway-host/claude-code-seat-wiring`, `gateway-host/host`,
`runtime-llm-mesh-account`); `gh pr checks 327 -R rhanka/h2a` green.
Reports under `.h2a/` stay untracked; the r8 report lives in
`.h2a/build/claude_seat_r8_report.md` (untracked) and the seat-model
inventory in `.h2a/build/seat_model_inventory.md` (untracked).
